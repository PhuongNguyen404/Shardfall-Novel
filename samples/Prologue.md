📄 Prologue Note – By Phuong Nguyen
In the world of Shardfall: Illusion of Truth, chaos isn’t a side effect — it’s the whole point.
Every rule is shattered. Every boundary pushed.
 And every player? A potential wrecking ball.
This isn’t a world of balance.
 It’s a server held together by glitchy code, caffeine-fueled updates, and the desperate hope that no one notices how broken it really is.

Enter the Headmaster — overworked, underpaid, and dangerously overwhelmed.
His job?
Keep the servers online


Stop players from tearing reality apart


And — oh right — hide the shards


No one told him where they came from.
 No one told him what they are.
 But everyone expects him to fix it.
All he knows is:
 They’re dangerous.
 And somehow… they keep showing up.
There’s no manual.
 No rollback plan.
 Just a sarcastic AI assistant named Chappy, who offers zero help and maximum attitude.
Together, they're tasked with maintaining order in a world allergic to it.

The players aren’t helping:
🛡️ The Pros are speedrunning the game like it’s a ranked tournament.
 🕳️ The Hackers are exploiting everything that isn’t nailed down (and some things that are).
 🤖 The AI Bots are cold, efficient, and silently terrifying.
 🧱 The Averages are just trying to build actual civilization — poor souls.
 🪨 The Noobs?
 They’re worshiping rocks again.
 One even built a shrine to moss.
It’s fine. Everything’s fine.

Factions haven’t even been assigned yet, and the chaos has already begun.
 The system is watching.
 Stats are tracking.
 And the Headmaster?
 He’s sweating through his admin cloak, trying to lock things down before it all explodes.

What players don’t know is that the shards are only part of the story.
They think they’re collecting rare loot — legendary gear, powerful relics, flashy perks.
 But each shard is tied to something deeper.
 Something hidden.
 Something alive.
The ???.
And when the wrong hands collect the right shards, the illusion shatters —
 —and the truth comes crawling out.

📡 Welcome to the server.
📅 Day Zero begins now.
